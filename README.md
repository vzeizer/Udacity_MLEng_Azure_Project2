# Operationalizing Machine Learning: Project 2 of Machine Learning Engineering with Microsoft Azure Nanodegree

*TODO:* Write an overview to your project.

In this project, the Bank Marketing Data set [from here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) will be used.
Azure will be used to configure a cloud-based machine learning model, deploying it and consuming it. 
A pipeline was created, published and consumed.
Finally, a screencast showing all the steps is provided below.

Basically, the following steps are going to be done:

1. Authentication
2. Automated ML Experiment
3. Deploy the Best Model
4. Enable Logging
5. Swagger documentation
6. Consume Model Endpoints
7. Create and publish a pipeline
8. Documentation

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. 
An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. 
In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, 
with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. 
For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. 
Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. 
Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions 
that you have attempted.
